      <strong>What I'm working on</strong>
    </h2>
    <div class="hero-list">
      <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Lead Developer at Nortech.ai - Digitalizing the marine sector</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Joined as a core team member from inception</li>
        <li>Developed across all layers: edge device data collection, cloud infrastructure, development tools, parsers, build pipelines, frontends, backends, database architecture, AI UI Streaming, UI abstractions for teammates, etc...</li>
        <li>Shaped team culture and practices, both in-person and remote  (team is split across Bergen and Lisbon)</li>
        <li>Net positive revenue from the first year</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><strong>How I work</strong></h2>      
      <li>Tools not rules - Prioritize good internal tooling, automate the golden path</li>
      <li>Measurement over intuition - It's a tradeoff, but I err on the side of measurement</li>
      <li>Iteration over planning - You (usually) get more information from trying it out and exploring the shape of the problem than from thinking about it.</li>
      <li>First draft, good draft - I build a shoddy version of the solution while iterating, then throw it out and write the good one</li>
      <li>Early adoption - There's a lot of advantage in adopting new technology early</li>
    </p>
      
    </p>

      <h2><strong>Relevant tidbits</strong></h2>
      <li>I'm <script>document.write(window.age)</script> years old</li>
      <li>I've been coding professionally for <script>document.write(window.age - 18)</script> years now</li>
      <li>I started scripting (JASS) at 11 to make custom wc3 maps</li>
      <li>Hosted my own WoW private server at 16, modding it to make my friends OP</li>
      <li>Skipped college to start working at 18.. Debatable decision</li>

      <h2>
        <strong>Current tech choices</strong>
      </h2>
      <h5>Infra</h5>
      <li>Kubernetes - Built several medium sized clusters</li>
      <li>AWS ecosystem - My usual cloud of choice. Lock-in conscious</li>
      <li>Dockerize everything - Not that hard, and makes deployment very flexible</li>
      <li>Gitlab/github pipelines - I'd rather not though, actively looking for the next evolution in CI/CD</li>
      <li>Terraform - also CDKTF early adopter </li>
      <li>Linux - Used several distros (arch btw) as personal work computers, and admined many linux servers</li>

      <h5>Web (base platform, many frameworks, servers)</h5>
      <li>Node.js - many production deployments</li>
      <li>React - since it showed up</li>
      <li>Next.js/Vercel - early adopter</li>
      <li>In the past many a framework was used, including rolling my own for internet 6(yes...) </li>

      <h5>Dev tooling</h5>
      <li>MacOS - Having a single platform for the team is more important than the linux gains</li>
      <li>Cursor w/VIM bindings - Best tradeoff of cross team extension building and personal productivity</li>
      <li>Nix - Setting up all the team envs with nix (ongoing...)</li>
      
      <h5>Teamwork</h5>
      <li>In person over remote - We're still not there, but VR might tip the scale soon</li>
      <li>Slack/discord - for remote comms. Discord has better API, slack has better enterprise face value</li>
      <li>Github - Code hosting</li>
      <li>Linear - Issue tracking, although usually *just fix it* is a better policy</li>
      <li>Monorepo - It's really hard to go back once you've worked with a monorepo daily</li>
      <li>Code syncing - (<a href="https://graphite.dev/">Graphite</a> - PR Stacking) || (trunk based development - with cutting releases for on prod ci pass)</li>
    </p>
    
    <hr/>
    
    <p>
      <h2>Languages I've used professionally</h2>
      <li>Typescript - since it showed up</li>
      <li>Rust - low power / high perf, edge computer code - actually in production</li>
      <li>Python - Barely, but now deployed a few services</li>
      <li>PHP - Good(debatable) old days</li>
      <li>Golang - A few production projects, mostly for low-level code</li>
      <li>Javacript - Many years, but there's barely any reason to write any anymore (except this very website :-)</li>
    </p>

    <hr/>
    
    <h2><strong>Stuff I've worked on before</strong></h2>
    <p>
      <p>Nearshoring @ https://mobinteg.com/ - Building in-house products and contract work for customers - 5 yrs</p>
      <p>Outsourcing @ https://altar.io/ - Building MVPs for companies - 1 yrs</p>
      <p>Regra - Oldschool portuguese company, not interesting work - 1 yr</p>
    </p>
    
    <hr />

    <h2><strong>What I'm not good at</strong></h2>
    <p>
      <li>Design - I have very little visual memory, internal visualization capabilities, and color awareness</li>
      <li>Delegating - I prefer to build tools to empower teammates with data and capabilities, rather than delegate</li>
      <li>Following up - I am not the most organized person, and will frequently lose track of emails and comms. Getting better at this is an explicit goal</li>
